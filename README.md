# Complex Picture Plotter
This is my Complex Picture Plotter program I made for an essay of mine. It may not be very effecient but it got the job done.
<b>To try it for yourself you will need to do the following.</b>
1) Install <i>Processing</i> on your computer. Just go to <a href="processing.org/download/">processing.org/download/</a> to download and install the version for your OS.
2) Install the <i>controlP5</i> library in <i>Processing</i>. This can be done by opening <i>Processing</i>, clicking the following in the toolbar: <i>Sketch > Import Library > Add Library</i>, then adding the <i>controlP5</i> library by selecting it and clicking "Install".
3) Open the <i>ComplexPicturePlotter.pde</i> file in <i>Processing</i>.

After doing those steps you should be able to click the play button and the plotter should run.
